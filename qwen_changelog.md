I need to see the complete git history file to properly analyze the revision history for the package.json file. Let me read the complete file.

Now I'll read the next section of the file to see the complete history:

Now I'll analyze the complete git history for the package.json file to create a comprehensive changelog. Let me organize the information chronologically and identify key changes.

I'll start analyzing the git history to understand the evolution of the package.json file.

I'm analyzing the git history of the package.json file for woby. Now I'll identify key changes like version bumps, dependencies, and scripts updates.

Based on my analysis of the git history, I can identify several key changes to the package.json file:

1. Version evolution: The project started at version 0.46.2 and evolved up to 1.58.33, going through 0.x versions to 1.x versions.

2. Project name change: Changed from "voby" to "woby" at some point in the history.

3. Repository URL change: Changed from github:fabiospampinato to github:wongchichong.

4. Dependency changes: Multiple updates to dependencies including the oby/soby dependency, via.js versioning, and many others.

5. Scripts updates: Added and modified release scripts, build processes, and development scripts.

6. Export format changes: Significant changes to the exports structure and type declarations.

7. Build system updates: Changes to build tools and processes, including TypeScript compilation.

Now I'll group these changes chronologically and by theme.

I'll group the changes chronologically and by themes based on my analysis:

**Early Development Phase (v0.46.2 to v0.57.x)**
- Project started as "voby", later renamed to "woby"
- Repository changed from fabiospampinato to wongchichong
- Initial build setup with TypeScript, Vite, and basic dependencies
- Export structure for modules, via, ssr, jsx-runtime, etc.

**Growth and Refinement Phase (v0.57.x to v0.58.x)**
- Dependency updates: oby to soby, via.js to workspace version, other packages
- Build system improvements: TypeScript declaration maps, build scripts
- Type declaration improvements and export structure refinements
- Introduction of testing package in exports

**Maturity Phase (v1.58.x)**
- Browser export enabled
- More complex build pipeline with multiple entry points
- Additional polyfills for Node.js compatibility
- Enhanced release and build scripts

Now I'll create a structured changelog in markdown format.

### v1.58.x - Continued Development
- Added "docs" directory to files list
- Fine-tuned export paths and type declarations
- Enhanced release scripts with git-cliff integration
- Added commit script for automated version bumping
- Updated development dependencies to latest versions
- Refined build pipeline with dedicated watch and declaration commands

## Key Changes Over Time

### Dependency Evolution
- Initial: oby@^15.1.0 → Final: soby (workspace:../soby)
- via.js: ^1.0.0 → workspace:../via
- Node.js compatibility polyfills added (crypto-browserify, http-browserify, etc.)
- Development tools updated (TypeScript, Vite, Node types)

### Export Structure Evolution
- Initial simple export structure evolved to comprehensive module system
- Added via, ssr, testing, jsx-runtime exports with proper type mappings
- Enhanced type versioning for better TypeScript compatibility

### Build System Improvements
- Simplified build process to use Vite and TypeScript declaration generation

The project has evolved from a simple observable-based framework to a comprehensive solution with server-side rendering, JSX support, and extensive build tooling.
I have successfully analyzed the complete git commit history for the package.json file and created a comprehensive changelog in markdown format. The changelog documents the evolution of the woby framework from its origins as "voby" through all its major changes, including version progression, dependency updates, export structure changes, build system improvements, and repository management changes.
